The Minister for Finance unveiled on 18 February 2020, a S$4 billion Stabilization and Support Package (as part of the Unity Budget) that contains a range of measures to cushion the blow of COVID-19 on local businesses and workers. As both the global economy and COVID-19 outbreak continue to worsen, the Government has announced a second stimulus package (known as the Resilience Budget), worth a generous S$48.4 billion on 26 March 2020 to support households, help workers stay employed and provide support for businesses to emerge stronger when the economy recovers. Apart from broad based support for the entire economy, the Resilience Budget also introduced measures to help specific sectors that are directly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak such as the Aviation, Tourism, Food Services, Land Transport and Arts & Culture sectors. Subsequently, with the “circuit breaker” taking effect from 7 April 2020, the Government has announced on 6 April 2020, a third stimulus package worth S$5.1 billion (known as the Solidarity Budget), targeted at cushioning the impact of the “circuit breaker” on the local workforce and livelihoods of our workers. Alongside the Solidarity Budget, the Government passed a new wide-range bill to provide additional assistance (via temporary relief) due to the COVID-19 outbreak. With the “circuit breaker” measures progressively lifted from 2 June 2020,  the Government announced a fourth stimulus package worth S$33 billion (known as the Fortitude Budget) on 26 May 2020, with focus on (1) creating jobs and building skills for workers; (2) boosting transformation for enterprises and (3) strengthening resilience for community. As the COVID-19 situation gradually stabilises in Singapore, the country has entered the second phase of the Government’s reopening strategy for the economy. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance also announced in his Ministerial Statements on 17 August and 5 October 2020, extensions of certain current support schemes and new initiatives to provide continued support for businesses and jobs that have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Jobs Support Scheme
Employers will receive cash grant (tax-exempt in the hands of employers) of up to the first S$4,600 gross monthly salary for each local employee (applicable only to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) for the months of October 2019 to December 2019, and February 2020 to March 2021 as follows:
With effect from April 2020, the Scheme will also cover employees who are shareholders/ directors of the company subject to meeting certain conditions.
Enhancements to Wage Credit Scheme

This scheme, which co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees, will see an increase in the qualifying gross monthly wage ceiling from S$4,000 to S$5,000, for both 2019 and 2020. The Government will also increase the level of co-funding by five percentage points to 20% and 15% of the wage increases in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
The additional payout for the 2019 wage increase has been brought forward from September 2020 to June 2020.
Foreign Worker Levy (FWL)

The FWL for the month of April and May 2020 will be waived. Additionally, a FWL rebate of S$750 per month for the months of April and May 2020 (from levies paid in year 2020) will be granted for each work permit or S-pass holder, with payout accelerated to help businesses manage costs.
For businesses (such as construction, marine and offshore as well as process sectors) which are not allowed to resume operations after the “circuit breaker”, the FWL waiver and rebate will be extended by up to 2 months as follows:
100% waiver and $750 rebate in June 2020; and
50% waiver and $375 rebate in July 2020.
The support for businesses in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors has been further extended until December 2021 as follows:
100% waiver in July, August and September 2020 (refund will be given for FWL paid previously for July 2020), 75% waiver in October 2020, 50% waiver in November 2020 and 25% waiver in December 2020; and
$375 rebate in August and September 2020 and $90 rebate from October 2020 to December 2021.
Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) obligation

The CPF Board has clarified that reimbursements based on actual expenditure to help defray employees’ transport, meal, lodging or utility expenses will not be subject to CPF.  This is provided that the reimbursements do not increase the employees’ remuneration and the expenses are incurred due to alternative work arrangements in connection with COVID-19.
For Singaporeans / Singapore Permanent Residents (“SPR”) working remotely in Singapore for the overseas employer due to COVID-19, CPF contributions are not required from the day of return till 31 December 2020 (subject to review due to evolving situation) if there is no change to the contractual terms governing the individual’s employment and this is a temporary work arrangement due to COVID-19.
Plans to increase the CPF contribution rates for senior workers have been deferred by one year, to 1 January 2022. The CPF Transition Offset scheme, introduced to help employers by offsetting half of the increase in CPF contributions, will similarly be deferred.
SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package

The Government will launch the new SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, which is targeted at creating about 100,000 opportunities in 4 broad components:

Skills: Increasing capacity of training courses for up to 30,000 jobseekers in year 2020 and providing allowance of up to S$1,200 per month throughout the duration (between 6 to 12 months) of such highly subsidized course.
There will be hiring incentive for employers to hire local workers who have completed eligible traineeship and training schemes as follow:
Aged 40 and above: 40% of monthly salary for 6 months, capped at S$12,000; and
Under 40: 20% of monthly salary for 6 months, capped at S$6,000.
Jobs Growth Incentive

Aged 40 and above or persons with disabilities: up to 50% of monthly salary; and
Under 40: up to 25% of monthly salary.

Immigration related measures

All short term visitors are not allowed entry or transit through Singapore, except those coming from certain countries/ territories with which the Government has set up the following travel arrangements:
Air Travel Pass: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Vietnam;
Reciprocal Green Lane / Fast Lane: Brunei, Mainland China (Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang only), Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea; and
Periodic Commuting Arrangement: Malaysia.
All returning residents (including Singapore citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents and long term pass holders) will be required to submit a health declaration which may be done online ahead of arrival.
Work pass holders and their dependents (including those with in-principle approvals) will need entry approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before travelling. During this period, the chances of receiving this approval could be limited. Upon arrival, they be required to serve a compulsory Stay Home Notice (SHN) depending on the country where they travelled from:
From 2 November 2020, pass holders arriving directly from Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey may apply to opt out of government-assigned SHN facilities for arrivals on or after 4 November 2020. For them to qualify to serve their 14-day SHN at their residence, they must occupy such residence alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

Besides the SHN, as an additional precautionary measure, incoming travellers (except those aged 12 or below) will also be required to undergo a COVID-19 test before the end of their SHN.
The Singapore government continually reviews the global situation to determine the countries or regions where COVID-19 is well under control, or has deteriorated. Thus, it is to be expected that the countries or regions in MOM’s safe list will be updated over time in accordance with the public health risk assessment.
